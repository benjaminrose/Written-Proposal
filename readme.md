# Oral Candidacy -- Written Proposal

This is my written proposal for my oral candidacy for Ph.D. in Physics at University of Notre Dame.

Github is used as a backup/transport system, with no intent for public/open use. If you want to uses something (figures, $\TeX$ styles) please ask me, or appropriately cite the published works. Please feel free to look at this for ideas about good- (or bad) practices, and other techniques. Learning form each other is a something I do not want to hinder.
